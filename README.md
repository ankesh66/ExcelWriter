# ExcelWriter
Small script to generate excel write operation code dynamically

In coding world we often need to generate excel report using database by doing very small computation and code is highly repetative
which is very boring stuff to do and often we make small typo during copy pasting and simply we loose lot of precious time to automate this process this script is highly elegent solution which generate all repetative stuff automatically left coder with only bussiness logic to work on

To run this code you need to pass two parameter whose description are there at document section of code

This create all boilerplate code and reduce error due to  copy pasting

NOTE : This works only for xlsx file extension
